## Writeup:

```
>>> Remote Enumeration
Started with basic remote enumeration. Host discovery, nmap scan, web-fuzzers m.m.
Found directories:
/logs/
/cctv/

In /logs/ were some log files. In maintenance we found some discrepencies (1).
It seems a cronjob is running and making file "web-control" and "product-control" world-RWX. and then executing them with "bash -c".
We enumerate some smb-shares and find there is share "ITDEPT" which is located at "/home/dawn/ITDEPT/". Coincidence? I think not.

So we put a basic reverse shell in web-control and product-control and start up our listener.
Product-control comes back and bam. We have compromised the machine.(2)
We stabalize the shell and start out Local Enumeration.

>>> Local Enumeration:
sudo -l shows us we're able to run mysql as root without a password.(3)
We could exploit this but there seems to be a faulty configuration. The password must be provided.
Further enumeration shows the user has left the md5crypted password echoed in the terminal. 
We grab that, crack that and perform a privilege escalation via the mysql.(4)(5)

Proof the box was fully compromised without the use of any known kernel exploits. (6)

Assessment Value: Critical!

## TAKEAWAYS

```
1. If mysql is able to run as root but requires password. Keep looking.
2.
3.
```

## OTHER VULNERABILITIS FOUND:

```bash
/usr/bin/zsh is has a setuid bit as root (1) 
can be exploited with the "/usr/bin/zsh -p" payload
```

```
the machine is also vulnerable to the CVE-2021-4034 exploit (1.1)
```
