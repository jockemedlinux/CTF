# TASK5: Engagement Documentation
```
Engagement documentation is an extension of campaign planning where ideas and thoughts of campaign planning are officially documented. In this context, the term "document" can be deceiving as some plans do not require proper documentation and can be as simple as an email; this will be covered later in this task.

In this task, we will cover a technical overview of the contents of each campaign plan prior to looking at the plans and documents themselves in upcoming tasks.

Engagement Plan:
Component	Purpose
CONOPS (Concept of Operations)
	Non-technically written overview of how the red team meets client objectives and target the client.
Resource plan
	Includes timelines and information required for the red team to be successfulâ€”any resource requirements: personnel, hardware, cloud requirements.

Operations Plan:
Component	Purpose
Personnel 
	Information on employee requirements.
Stopping conditions
	How and why should the red team stop during the engagement.
RoE (optional)
	-
Technical requirements
	What knowledge will the red team need to be successful.

Mission Plan:
Component	Purpose
Command playbooks (optional)
	Exact commands and tools to run, including when, why, and how. Commonly seen in larger teams with many operators at varying skill levels.
Execution times
	Times to begin stages of engagement. Can optionally include exact times to execute tools and commands.
Responsibilities/roles
	Who does what, when.

Remediation Plan (optional):
Component	Purpose
Report

Remediation/consultation 
	How will the client remediate findings? It can be included in the report or discussed in a meeting between the client and the red team.

# TASK10: Conclusion
```


We have covered how you can quantify campaign plans into documents and prepare for a successful red team engagement in this room. The consistent theme throughout this room has been that each red team will have its internal documents and way of doing things. This is a crucial concept to understand when moving into the real world. This room only acts as a guide to get you used to concepts and ideas and provides a framework to use, not as a definitive step-by-step manual. When planning an engagement, remember that your number 1 goal is to meet the client's objectives.

Planning and documenting are often overlooked and are crucial to a successful engagement.
